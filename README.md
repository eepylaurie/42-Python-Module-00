# 🌱 Growing Code - Python Module 00

This module introduces the fundamentals of the Python programming language through a series of small, garden-themed exercises.

Rather than building a single large program, the module focuses on learning how Python works at a language level by writing short, independent functions.

The exercises are structured so that each one adds a new layer of understanding. Together, they cover the core building blocks required to start programming in Python.

## Concepts introduced

The module gradually introduces the following Python concepts:

### Basic language syntax

### Input and output

### Variables and types

### Control flow

### Repetition

### Functions

### Type annotations

### Code style

---

This module builds the foundation required to move on to more advanced topics such as data structures, object-oriented programming, and larger Python projects.
